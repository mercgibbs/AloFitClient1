                         <ul>
                <li>Vinyasa: a style of yoga that is practiced linking conscious breath with dynamic fluid movement. A number of Yoga postures (Asanas) are linked together in a sequence which flows together</li>
                <br><!--Delete br. Only li can be in ul. If you want more space between add margin to li-->
                <li> Barre: a toning, body-weight-lifting workout,” It engages muscles you wouldn't normally target—ones deep inside your body that squats, lunges and sit-ups don't reach. With high-reps and low-impact movements, barre challenges anyone looking to fine-tune their muscles</li>
                <br><!--Delete br. Only li can be in ul. If you want more space between add margin to li-->
                <li>Yin/Meditation: a slow-paced and therapeutic style of yoga. Through a specific series of postures, it creates the space for you to tune into your inner experience.</li>

                <br><!--Delete br. Only li can be in ul. If you want more space between add margin to li-->
                <li> Core Flow: vinyasas are taken between sequences of poses, building heat in the body as it moves. Poses are specific towards core and back strengthening, so you can expect a lot of high and low plank, boat pose, back bends, and side planks!</li>
                <br><!--Delete br. Only li can be in ul. If you want more space between add margin to li-->
                <li>Slow Flow: In a typical Slow Flow class, you will practice about half the number of poses you might practice in a Flow class. The pace is meditative, emphasizing peace and calm in body and mind. We hold poses longer, taking several rounds of breath in each pose, instead of moving to each breath.</li>

                <li>Hips and Hammies: It's all about awareness and loving yourself. This yoga practice gets FIERY with a focus on opening in the hips, stretching the hamstrings, a core connect... and some neck and shoulder love.</li>
